eclipse, java, Wrapper class

What is JDK ?
Whether Java is 100% OOPS language ?
Ans : No because
1. Java supports primitive data types.
2. Java supports static access modifires. Static members can be accessed without object reference.

What is the problem for Java supports primitive data types ?
The primitive data types do not abide by the principles of OOPS.
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Association
        |
Aggregation     Composition

class Citizen{
  int aadharCardNumber;
  String name;
   Date dob;
  Address citizenAddress;
  Votercard voterInfo;
}


class Address{
    String houseNumber;
     String streetName;
     String cityName;
    int pin;

} --->Aggregation

class Votercard{
     long voterId;
     String constituencyName;
    String partName;

  }--->Composition


What are Wrapper classes:- they are the primitive data types covered through OOPS principles.
Why Wrapper classes are required?
 In java, there are some areas where only data which follow the principles of OOPS are permitted for processiong , on those areas how to use primitive data type data? Here comes the Wrapper class.

Which are those areas:
generic, collection framework, Session variables in JSP & Servlet.

There are 9 Wrapper classes
  Boolean
   Byte
   Short
   Character
   Integer
   Float
   Long
   Double
  Number

  Boolean  Character  Number
                                         |
  Byte  Short  Integer Long Float Double

 All Wrapper classes are immutable

  Conversion from Primitive to Wrapper is known as Boxing
    int x=20;
   char p='Z';
   Integer ig=new Integer(x);
   Character ch=new Character(p);
 from JDK1.6 --->  Autoboxing
   Integer jg=x;
   Character sh=p;
  Integer k=35;
  Double d=3.75;
  Character g='W';


Conversion from Wrapper  to Primitive is known as UnBoxing
  int y=jg;
  char q=sh;

 compareTo() ----> present in all wrapper classes.
 It compares  two wrapper class objects of same type.
  if 1st object is higher than 2nd one, it returns a +ive value.
if 1st object is lesser than 2nd one, it returns a -ive value.
if both objects are equal, it returns 0.

Intoduction to JShell, var, Final, Object class, Wrapper classes


Object, final, abstract, interface, String functions


What is the Object class ?
It is the base class of all classes in Java. It is present in java.lang package.


class A {
             }

class B extends A{

}


1.   A      Object
      |         |
    ------------
         |
        B

2.      Object
              |
             A
              |
             B
How JVM identify an element as an instance of a class ?
Ans: When an element can be referred by the reference variable of Object class, JVM will consider it as an instance of a class.

toString() returns a String/textual representation of the object.

What is final class ?
What is final method ?
What is final variable ?
final variable can be a local variable or only global/instance variable ?

What is abstract method ?
In a class the member function/method whose body cannot be defined.
It is normally declared in base classes.
It must be overriden in derive classes.

What is abstract class ?
The class whose instance cannot be declared/initilialized.
The key word abstract must be placed before class name.
If any method of a class is abstract then that class is also an abstract class.

What is interface ?
 It is a collection of abstract methods. It provides guidlines to the classes regarding methods and asks the classes who uses the interface to define those methods as per their requirement.  
From Java 9
interface can have default method which has body.
interface can have static method which has body. 


The class which uses an interface, the keyword for the use is implements.
 interface MyDemo
  {
      public void show();
      public void getdata();
  }
 class MyApplication implements MyDemo{
      public void putdata(){
       }
        public void show(){
         }
      public void getdata(){
       }
}
interface cannot have constructor so it's instance cannot be declared.
interface can declare reference variable which referes to inplementing class object.
interface can have member data which is automitally static & final.
interface member functions/methods are by default public
A class can implement multiple interfaces.
an interface can inherit multiple other interfaces by using keyword extends
if the base class implements one interface, then derive class is also autometically implementing that interface.

  MyApplication ma=new MyApplication();
 what is ma ?----> reference variable of MyApplication type
what is new MyApplication() ?---> it is the dynamically created object/instance of MyApplication.
