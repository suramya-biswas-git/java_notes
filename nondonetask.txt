eclipse, java, Wrapper class

What is JDK ?
Whether Java is 100% OOPS language ?
Ans : No because
1. Java supports primitive data types.
2. Java supports static access modifires. Static members can be accessed without object reference.

What is the problem for Java supports primitive data types ?
The primitive data types do not abide by the principles of OOPS.
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Association
        |
Aggregation     Composition

class Citizen{
  int aadharCardNumber;
  String name;
   Date dob;
  Address citizenAddress;
  Votercard voterInfo;
}


class Address{
    String houseNumber;
     String streetName;
     String cityName;
    int pin;

} --->Aggregation

class Votercard{
     long voterId;
     String constituencyName;
    String partName;

  }--->Composition


What are Wrapper classes:- they are the primitive data types covered through OOPS principles.
Why Wrapper classes are required?
 In java, there are some areas where only data which follow the principles of OOPS are permitted for processiong , on those areas how to use primitive data type data? Here comes the Wrapper class.

Which are those areas:
generic, collection framework, Session variables in JSP & Servlet.

There are 9 Wrapper classes
  Boolean
   Byte
   Short
   Character
   Integer
   Float
   Long
   Double
  Number

  Boolean  Character  Number
                                         |
  Byte  Short  Integer Long Float Double

 All Wrapper classes are immutable

  Conversion from Primitive to Wrapper is known as Boxing
    int x=20;
   char p='Z';
   Integer ig=new Integer(x);
   Character ch=new Character(p);
 from JDK1.6 --->  Autoboxing
   Integer jg=x;
   Character sh=p;
  Integer k=35;
  Double d=3.75;
  Character g='W';


Conversion from Wrapper  to Primitive is known as UnBoxing
  int y=jg;
  char q=sh;

 compareTo() ----> present in all wrapper classes.
 It compares  two wrapper class objects of same type.
  if 1st object is higher than 2nd one, it returns a +ive value.
if 1st object is lesser than 2nd one, it returns a -ive value.
if both objects are equal, it returns 0.

Intoduction to JShell, var, Final, Object class, Wrapper classes


Object, final, abstract, interface, String functions


What is the Object class ?
It is the base class of all classes in Java. It is present in java.lang package.


class A {
             }

class B extends A{

}


1.   A      Object
      |         |
    ------------
         |
        B

2.      Object
              |
             A
              |
             B
How JVM identify an element as an instance of a class ?
Ans: When an element can be referred by the reference variable of Object class, JVM will consider it as an instance of a class.

toString() returns a String/textual representation of the object.

What is final class ?
What is final method ?
What is final variable ?
final variable can be a local variable or only global/instance variable ?

What is abstract method ?
In a class the member function/method whose body cannot be defined.
It is normally declared in base classes.
It must be overriden in derive classes.

What is abstract class ?
The class whose instance cannot be declared/initilialized.
The key word abstract must be placed before class name.
If any method of a class is abstract then that class is also an abstract class.

What is interface ?
 It is a collection of abstract methods. It provides guidlines to the classes regarding methods and asks the classes who uses the interface to define those methods as per their requirement.  
From Java 9
interface can have default method which has body.
interface can have static method which has body. 


The class which uses an interface, the keyword for the use is implements.
 interface MyDemo
  {
      public void show();
      public void getdata();
  }
 class MyApplication implements MyDemo{
      public void putdata(){
       }
        public void show(){
         }
      public void getdata(){
       }
}
interface cannot have constructor so it's instance cannot be declared.
interface can declare reference variable which referes to inplementing class object.
interface can have member data which is automitally static & final.
interface member functions/methods are by default public
A class can implement multiple interfaces.
an interface can inherit multiple other interfaces by using keyword extends
if the base class implements one interface, then derive class is also autometically implementing that interface.

  MyApplication ma=new MyApplication();
 what is ma ?----> reference variable of MyApplication type
what is new MyApplication() ?---> it is the dynamically created object/instance of MyApplication.

Exception Handling


system.out.println("hello how are you");

syntax error

int x=7;
int y=2;
int z=x/y;
z=?  ==>3

logical error


runtime error
What is runtime error:?
It is a type of error which generates due to absence of any resource (hardware or software) or an application asks to perform illegal operation like divide by zero etc.
When a runtime error occures an abnormal situation prevails and the application cannot procced further. The application abruptly halts itself. 
The runtime error is known as Exception
If Exception occures, we should try to restore normalcy. It is called exception handling.

In Java the runtime error is handled by a class Throwable. It is present in java.lang package. It is directly extends Object class.
                                                Object
                                                     |
                                            Throwable
                                                     |
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  |                                                                                            |
Error                                                                               Exception

Error class : It is a kind of runtime error which cannot handle programmaticaly.
Exception class: It is a kind of  runtime error which can handle programmaticaly.
try block--->code to task---code for the program
catch block--->code to handle abnormal situation(exception) in case it oocures.
finally block--->it's code will be executed compulsory. Whether normal or abnormal situation occures.

 try {


  }
catch(){}
catch(){}
catch(){}

 try {


  }
finally{}

There are serveral exception classes are provided by Java/JDK. All these exception classes are derived from class Exception. 
During client's project development, if there is a requirement for some exceptions which satisfy the client's business need but those exceptions are not present in JDK, here comes the custom's/user define exceptions.

How to create user defined exception class ?

throw clause alerts JVM an user defined exception has been occured .

Under the same try block there exist parent exception & child exception classes, in that case catch block for child exception comes before the parent. 

There are some situations where Exception handling codes are not present, compiler will show error message. These kind of Exceptions are checked by compiler so they are called checked exception.  All checked exceptions are directly extends the Exception.
eg:  IOException, FileNotFoundException, SQLException, InterreptedException, ClassNotFoundException etc.


All unchecked exceptions directly extends RuntimeException
class MyApplication {
public void myFunction() throws SQLException, FileNotFoundException, InterreptedException,ClassNotFoundException{

-----
-----
------
-----
}
}

What is the diff between throw & throws clause ?

What is functional interface ?
The interface which has one and only one abstract method. It may have any numbers of static and default methods. 

var datatype of Java 11.

it is an independent data type.
var x=10;
var y="Hello";
var z=3.75;
Once a value is assigned to a var variable, that variable will become data type that value.
It cannot set to null.
It cannot be declared as global/instance variable as a class.
It can act only as local variable.

 
class Parent{
  public void show(){
    }

}


class Child extends Parent{
   public void show(){
     super.show();
      }

}
Collection Framework Generic
List Set Map

What is collection ?
                                                   Collection
 database------------------------>Container<-------------------->website
   Oracle/DB2                          c#/Java/Python      html/css/javascript                                     
                                                   
What is Collection Framework in Java ?
It is a collection of classes, interfaces to store multiple instances of a class.
Each of the collection class follows a data structure principle.
In Java all collection classes & interfaces are present in java.util package.
It is called framework why ?

What is List ----> It stores the elements according to the order of entry. Duplicate elements are permitted.
What is Set ----> It stores only unique elements. Duplicate element is rejected. It does not maintain the order of entry.
TreeSet--->  It stores only unique elements. It sorts entries according to the ascending order.

Arrays are always type safe.
Comparator interface
Set,Map & Regex

 List--->
Collections.sort()----> List

Set--->
Which is the fastest collection class--->HashSet

Map---> It is a type of collection where every data element is stored with an unique id for that data element. The data element is called "value" & unique id is called "key".
The value can be duplicated but key must be unique.
It is also part of Java Collection framework but it is not inherated from Collection interface.

How many interfaces are derived from Collection interface ?
Map ---> supports mutiple null values in value portion, but only one null in key side. Again for only HashMap, LinkedHashMap classes. TreeMap does not allow null value as key.

Write a Java application that will accept the date of birth of a person in dd-mm-yyyy format and then say that whether that person is a senior citizen or not on the basis of today's date.
